## Adding a New Component

**Create Your Component**

Add your component file in `packages/ui/src/sections`. Use lowercase for the filename.

**Example:**

```bash
import { ArrowLeft } from 'lucide-react';
import Heading from "@/components/ui/heading";
import React from 'react';

export default function Button() {
  return (
    <>
      <Heading />
      <button className="rounded-full px-4 py-2 bg-black">
        Get Started
        <ArrowLeft />
      </button>
    </>
  );
}

```

**Use Subcomponents if Needed**
If your component has subcomponents, make sure they are imported from `packages/ui/src/components/ui`.

**Example:**

```bash
import Heading from "@/components/ui/heading";
```

**Adding sources(Images)**

If your component requires images, add them in `apps/web/public`.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new Button component"
git push origin my-new-component
```

Finally, open a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main repository and link it to any relevant issue.
